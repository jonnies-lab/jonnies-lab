- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonnies-lab
- 👀 I’m interested in UI/UX design and web development. I would like to dive deeper into python. A little experience working with the language academically. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Logistics and Supply Chain Management at the Universtiy level of education.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with experience tutors and mentor. I would like to collaborate on a few projects i have in mind and to gradually increase my familarity with all tools with UI design and front-end.
- 📫 How to reach will be through my email, not sure if i should leave it here or not. Still trying to understand the whole system ...
